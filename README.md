JSON with Comments for Vim
==========================

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) syntax highlighting plugin for JSON with C-style
line (`//`) and block (`/* */`) comments.

It defines a filetype named `jsonc` (matching the name used in [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments),
a [Microsoft parser library](https://github.com/Microsoft/node-jsonc-parser),
[.mocharc.jsonc](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/pull/3760), and the [jsonc
npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonc)) which can be applied to
files using [`set ft=jsonc`](https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27filetype%27) or a
[modeline](https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#modeline).

These syntax highlighting settings are based on kevinoids version
at https://github.com/kevinoid/vim-jsonc. This version extends the JSON
syntax not only by allowing comments within JSON data files but
also allows trailing commas at the end of lists.

## Implementation

This plugin loads the JSON syntax plugin, clears the syntax group for
trailing commas in lists, for comments as errors, then defines
additional syntax to match C-style comments.

This project was inspired by, and the code is based on,
[elzr/vim-json#61](https://github.com/elzr/vim-json/pull/61) by
[**@TheLocehiliosan**](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan).


## Contributing

Contributions are appreciated!  Please add tests where possible and ensure
`./run-tests.sh` passes.

If the desired change is large, complex, backwards-incompatible, can have
significantly differing implementations, or may not be in scope for this
project, opening an issue before writing the code can avoid frustration and
save a lot of time and effort.
